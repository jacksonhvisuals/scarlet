A free, material-design template for the web - sibling to Quicksilver

## Getting Started:
- First, [Download the latest release](https://github.com/jacksonhvisuals/scarlet/releases/latest) directly from GitHub.

- You'll be presented with a number of files. The stuff you want to concern yourself with are index.html and two folders: /json, and /images.

- Throw a SQUARE image of yourself, your logo, whatever, inside /images. In index.html, edit the src value for profileImage to point to that profile image.

- Replace "Your name" with... your name.
- Replace the little description under that with some description about yourself.

- Edit the href value of the Contact link. It should be equal to href="mailto:[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]". Obviously, change the text of the tag, too.

- Also very important in index.html is going to be the METADATA. Up inside the head tag, edit the dummy content in the meta tags with real data.

- Add a favicon from realfavicongenerator.net.

- After that, open up the /json folder and take a look at links.json. Should be fairly straightforward, but here's a little explanation: 'color' is the color of the icon. 'icon' is the name of the icon from [materialdesignicons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Make sure you get the correct spelling for the icon (you don't need the 'mdi-' part, the script automatically adds that). url is... the URL.

- After you've edited the links.json file, you're ready to move on to items.json. This is pretty similar to the links.json file. A couple things to note, however. First, you'll need to supply an image for each item. Second, you HAVE to have all of said images match in EXACT dimensions. I suggest 1920x1080. If it's 1920x1081, things break. It's just a constraint of the [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) framework that we're using.

- If you need to delete or add a link or work-item to your new Scarlet website, it's super easy, thanks to the JSON implementation.

- After you feel like your website is ready to hit production, HIT THAT (figurative) UPLOAD BUTTON!
